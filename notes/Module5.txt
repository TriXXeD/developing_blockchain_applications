Events are only emitted once the transaction is actually confirmed
Events are also part of the blockchain state and are therefore stored for eternity.

Events are harder to test
Testing locally we can use something like this:
const txResult = myContract.transactionWhichResultsInAnEvent()
const events = txResult.events
// now we can inspect the events
console.log(events)

but network has difference RPC API, i.e. won't return the same.
