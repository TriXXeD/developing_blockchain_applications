Milestone 2 example:
    Avoid HTML in contract
    Treat contract as back-end business logic

    Front-end (UI)
    app.use
        Set initialize values here (state.VALNAME = INIT_VAL)
    event listeners for stuff to happen
        emitter.on('funcName', async (arg) => {js stuff})
    Best practice - minimal front end to pull data from the contact.

Unlock Account?
    Used when an account on node is used.
    trans is made on external acc via node
    Uncommonly used, more of a local testing thing

Why are containers treated differently (container = state object?)
    due to immuteability
    you point to data instead of putting data
    Low storage requirements to keep gas costs down

Randomness
    Distribued system seed data makes Randomness hard
    Blockhash is a bad source due to malicousness from miners

IPFS
    Basically like torrents
