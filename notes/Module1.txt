Hello World Example
pragma solidity 0.4.24;

contract HelloWorld {
  function helloWorld() public pure returns (string) {
    return "Hello, World!";
  }
}

Pure = does not read or write to blockchain
Constructor syntax:
constructor (string _message) public {
    myMessage = _message;
}

Self destruct funktion is the only way to remove code from blockchain
